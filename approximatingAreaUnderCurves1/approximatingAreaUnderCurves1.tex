\title{approximating area under curves1}

\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
	We can approximate the area under a curve by the sum of the areas of a bunch of rectangles.	
\end{abstract}

\maketitle

We have been studying differential calculus, the basic question of which is "What is the slope of the tangent line to a function at a point?".  We now turn to \textbf{integral} calculus, the basic question of which is "What is the (signed) area  bounded by the graph of a function?"

Our basic approach will be to approximate the area under a curve with a sum of areas of rectangles.

\begin{question}
	Let $f(x) = x^2+1$.  Divide the interval $[0,1]$ into $3$ subintervals of equal width.  Base a rectangle on each subinterval, whose height is given by the function value at the left endpoint.  Then the sum of the areas of these rectangles is a (crude) approximation of the area under $f$ on the interval $[0,1]$.

	The sum of the areas of these rectangles is \answer{ (1+(1+1/9)+(1+4/9)/3)}
\end{question}

To write these kind of sums in a more compact notation, we introduce sigma notation:

\begin{definition}
	Let $C(k)$ be a function which accepts integer inputs $k$.  Then if $a < b$, $\Sum_{k=a}^{k=b} C(k)$ is defined to be the sum $C(a)+C(a+1)+C(a+2)+\dots +C(b-1)+C(b)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	$\Sum_{k=2}^{k=5} k^2 = 2^2+3^2+4^2+5^2$
\end{example}

\begin{question}
	$\Sum_{k=1}^{k=3} k = $\answer{6}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
	If we want to write the sum $(1+2(0))+(1+2(1))+(1+2(2))+(1+2(3))$ in sigma notation, in the form $\Sum_{k=0}^{k=3} C(k)$, then $C(k)=$\answer{1+2k}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
	\begin{hint}
		All of the rectangles have width $\frac{1}{10}$.
	\end{hint}
	\begin{hint}
		The height of the third rectangle is $1+(\frac{2}{10})^2$.  Note that this corresponds to $k=2$, since we are counting $k=0,1,2,...$.  So the area of the rectangle corresponding to $k=2$ is $(1+(\frac{2}{10})^2) \cdot \frac{1}{10}$.
	\end{hint}
	Let $f(x) = x^2+1$.  Divide the interval $[0,1]$ into $10$ subintervals of equal width.  Base a rectangle on each subinterval, whose height is given by the function value at the left endpoint.  Then the sum of the areas of these rectangles is a (crude) approximation of the area under $f$ on the interval $[0,1]$.

	If we write the sum of the areas of these rectangles in sigma notation, in the form $\Sum_{k=0}^{k=9} C(k)$, then $C(k) = $\answer{(1+k^2/100)/10}
\end{question}
