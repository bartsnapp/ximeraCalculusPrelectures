Let me tell you about \textit{Project Excelsior}. \textit{Project
  Excelsior} was a top secret project initiated in 1958 to study high
altitude ejection systems. The plan was this: Joe Kittinger would ride
a balloon up to an extreme altitude (31333 meters) and then jump from
the balloon's gondola. Here is a video:

Kittinger held the world record for high altitude jumps until 2012, when Felix Baumgartner jumped from a balloon at an altitude of 38969 meters as part of the \textit{Red Bull Stratos} project. 

TERMINAL VELOCITY!
