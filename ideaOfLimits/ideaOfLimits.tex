\title{The idea of limits}

\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
  This activity will motivate the need for limits in mathematics.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

Limits appear in real world settings. In fact, your GPS device (or
phone) can use limits to estimate your velocity by computing
\textit{average velocity} on small time frames. You've known how to
compute average velocity for some time, it is just
\[
\text{average velocity} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}.
\]
However, we are typically more interested in velocity at a specific
instant. This is called \textit{instantaneous velocity}. What does
this have to do with limits? 
\begin{center}
  \textbf{Instantaneous velocity is the limit of average velocity as the time frame goes to zero.} 
\end{center}



Let's use these ideas to analyze some data. On the 12th of April in
1961, the Soviet Union launched Yuri Gagarin into space. Gagarin became
first human to orbit the Earth. Not to be outdone, less than one month
later the United States launched Alan Shepard into space. However, not
only was Shepard's flight second, it was also \textit{suborbital},
meaning he did not orbit the Earth. Shepard's flight went up and then
came back down and the entire flight was less than 16 minutes
long. Nevertheless, the plot of Shepard's flight is ripe for analysis
via average velocity. Using data from \textit{Conference on Results of
  the First U.S. Manned Suborbital Space Flight (1961 : Washington,
  D.C.)}, we have constructed a plot of Alan Shepard's altitude over
time:

Alan Shepard's flight reached apogee (its highest point) around 300
seconds into the flight.

Around 500 seconds into the flight, Alan Shepard's capsule reentered
the atmosphere. This slowed the speed of the capsule considerably.
