\maketitle

Limits appear in real world settings. In fact, your GPS device (or
phone) can use limits to estimate your velocity by computing
\textit{average velocity} on small time frames. You've known how to
compute average velocity for some time, it is just
\[
\text{average velocity} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}.
\]
However, we are typically more interested in velocity at a specific
instant. This is called \textit{instantaneous velocity}.

\begin{question}
  %% Maybe a ball toss is better? 
  %% Not  sure. 
  Give a plot and ask about average velocities of smaller and smaller
  settings. Maybe driving from Columbus OH to Myrtle Beach SC.
